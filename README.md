# Auto-rig-for-maya
This is a personal project I have been working on this summer. It provides an auto rig tool to rig a human character in maya.

It follows the following steps: 
1) A set of empty appear (a meta rig) that the user places on each part of the body of the character
2) A full body rig is then created
3) The hidden bones need to be removed from any weights
4) The user can animate the character

The rig comes with an IK/FK switch either simple or on spot.
