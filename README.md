# Auto-rig-for-maya
This is a personal project I have been working on this summer. It provides an auto rig tool to rig a human character in maya.

It follows the following steps: 
1) A set of empty appear (a meta rig) that the user places on each part of the body of the character
2) A full body rig is then created
3) The hidden bones need to be removed from any weight paints. For now it is a manual step but can easily made automatic. You have to remove IK and FK chains from the weight paints manually. 
4) The user can animate the character

The rig comes with an IK/FK switch either simple or on spot.
